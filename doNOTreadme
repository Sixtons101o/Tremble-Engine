HELLO welcome to tremble engine
Tremble engine is an experimental game engine for love2d and uses the lua programming language
soon you will be able to code in scripting languages by me but that is not yet implemented 
if you wanna learn how to use love2d and lua i suggest you use these youtube tutorials

although this engine is not yet complete and is in its beta form but it is good for love2d beginners 
but for now just wait until the engine is complete

(typescript to lua coming soon...)
